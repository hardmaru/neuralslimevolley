# Neural Slime Volleyball

HTML5-JS Slime Volleyball clone.  AI agent is a trained recurrent neural network, trained using basic conventional neuroevolution techniques.  Neural network implemented using the [convnetjs](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/) library.  It is very difficult to win!
